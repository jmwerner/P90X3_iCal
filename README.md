# P90X3_iCal
___
This simple script will generate a `.ics` calendar file with all of the P90X3 workouts from a given starting date. Each day's workout will be created at the same time and for a one hour duration (because that looks prettier in the calendar than a 30 minute event). Be sure all modules are installed and enter your own values for `start_date` and `directory` in the python script. Finally, execute the script and rejoice in the glory of Tony Horton. 

###### Credits
This script was inspired by examples from [this](https://github.com/collective/icalendar) repo and several other python documentation websites. I am not too familiar with Python, so I apologize for any sloppy or poorly styled code. Feel free to submit a pull request and teach me a few things :)
